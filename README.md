# CPU-Scheduling-Algorithms-with-Multitasking-and-Syncronization

## Introduction

This project is a simulation of CPU Scheduling Algorithms with Multitasking and Synchronization in Java. The goal of this project is to demonstrate the different CPU Scheduling Algorithms and how they handle multitasking and synchronization in a multithreaded environment. The algorithms included in this simulation are:

First Come First Serve (FCFS)

Preemptive Shortest Job First (SJF)

Non-Preemptive Shortest Job First (SJF)

Priority Scheduling

Round Robin Scheduling

## How to Run the Program

To run the program, simply clone the repository and open it in your favorite Java IDE. Then, run the Main class in the package. A GUI will be displayed where you can input the details of the processes and choose which scheduling algorithm to run.

## Synchronization

Synchronization is the mechanism that ensures only one thread can access a shared resource at a time. This is necessary in a multithreaded environment to prevent race conditions and ensure the correctness of the program. In this project, synchronization is implemented using Java's built-in synchronization mechanisms such as the synchronized keyword and java.util.concurrent.locks.Lock.

## Multitasking

Multitasking is the ability of the CPU to switch between multiple processes in order to execute multiple tasks at the same time. In this project, multitasking is simulated by creating multiple threads for each process, where each thread represents a process.

## Conclusion

This project provides a simulation of different CPU Scheduling Algorithms with Multitasking and Synchronization in Java. It demonstrates how the algorithms handle multitasking and synchronization and provides a visual representation of the results. This project can be used as a reference or educational tool for understanding the concepts of CPU Scheduling and Multithreading in Java.
